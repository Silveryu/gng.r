# Since initial clusterization is random. It may be a good idea to run cec multiple times and choose the best result.

# Better than before, however, we know that clusters are spherical; let's inform cec about that.

# Ain't that great? :D

# You can learn details of clustering like this

# You can predict cluster which a point would belong to:

# You can visualise size and shape of clusters
