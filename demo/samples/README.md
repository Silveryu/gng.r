To run demo compilation install pandadoc (from website, for instance they have .deb for Debians) and
then install http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pander/index.html - might require downloading
manually tar.gz and running `R CMD INSTALL <file_name>` 

Then you can compile by running `R --vanilla < compile.R`
