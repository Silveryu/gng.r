# For advanced used you might want to consider using OptimizedGNG
# , which asymptotically much faster implementation without
# sacrifying quality of the graph

# GNG unique capability is online training

library(gmum.r)

# Construct 10^6 points spherical dataset. Might take a while!
sphere.dataset <- gng.preset.sphere(N=10000)

# If you decide to use this advanced feature, you have to pass
# range in which all passed data will reside
gng <- OptimizedGNG(sphere.dataset, max.nodes=1000, max.iter=10000, dim=3, 
                    value.range=c(0,1))


# GNG would much longer, you can check it yourself
# gng <- GNG(sphere.dataset, max.nodes=1000, max.iter=10000, dim=3)
